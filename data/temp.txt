DSA -  is a way to optimize (dsa is computer science subject, not a tool)

OOPs is a style of programming

which language is best for backend development?
= it depends on the project requirements and the team's expertise. Some popular backend languages include Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js.
= it depends on the type of application you are building. 
For example, Python is a good choice for data analysis and machine learning applications,
while Java is commonly used for enterprise applications. 
Ruby is known for its simplicity and ease of use, 
while Node.js is popular for building real-time web applications.

- JS has everything 
if you want to build an application 
- in less amount of time
- with less setup
- with less infrastructure cost.
Then use JavaScript.

If you build highly scalable application then use Java for backend.
If you build a data analysis, AI/ML application then use Python for backend
Go for Ruby if you want to build a simple application with less complexity.
If you want to build a real-time web application then use Node.js for backend.
Go lang is best for building highly concurrent applications.

Which language is best for frontend development?
= JavaScript is the best language for frontend development.
= JavaScript is the only language that runs in the browser and can be used to create interactive web pages and web applications.
= JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js that make frontend development easier and more efficient.
= JavaScript is also widely supported by browsers and has a large community of developers who contribute to its growth and improvement.

What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?
= Java is a statically typed language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is used for building enterprise applications, web services, and Android apps.
= JavaScript is a dynamically typed language that runs in the browser and is used for creating interactive web pages and web applications.
= Java is a general-purpose language that is used for a wide range of applications, while JavaScript is specifically designed for web development.

till now, tensorflow is the best library for AI/ML, but not yet for JavaScript.

tensorflow.js is a library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.
- It is built on top of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library developed by Google.
- TensorFlow.js allows developers to build and train models using JavaScript and deploy them in the browser or on the server.
